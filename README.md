# MAMBO Project WP4 - review and outline plan

[Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biodiversity](https://www.mambo-project.eu/) is an EU project in which UKCEH is a partner. 

This repository holds the early contributions of the Research Software Engineering team to the project - testing prototypes, identifying parallel open source projects which could augment or replace early work, and packaging for re-use.

If needed it can move to a dedicated MAMBO organisation, for now it's here.
